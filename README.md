The OpenCore hackintosh build for a personal built PC with the Below Configurations :

Processor : i5-8600k 8th gen 6-Core 3.6Ghz

Ram : 8GB 2400Mhz DDR4

Storage : Sandisk 240 GB SATA SSD (+) 2x 500GB Seagate SATA HDD

Motherboard : MSI Z370 Gaming M5

Graphics : Intel Integrated UHD Graphics 630

The Above EFI is completely working with no boot errors with the geiven configuration.

The Build lacks WIFI and Bluetooth, As the motherboard doesn't integrate any wifi and bluetooth hardware.I am planning to buy the hardware driver seperately and update the EFI with the suitable kexts and config.plist file
