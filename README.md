# Opencore BigSur Hackintosh-Build-for-i5-8600k

## Credits : https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/prerequisites.html


Completely working OpenCore hackintosh build for a personal built PC with the Below Configurations :

> #### Processor : i5-8600k 8th gen 6-Core 3.6Ghz (Coffee Lake)
> #### Ram : 8GB 2400Mhz DDR4
> #### Storage : Sandisk 240 GB SATA SSD (+) 2x 500GB Seagate SATA HDD
> #### Motherboard : MSI Z370 Gaming M5
> #### Graphics : Intel Integrated UHD Graphics 630 


The Build lacks both WIFI and Bluetooth, As the motherboard doesn't integrate any wifi and bluetooth hardware.
I am planning to buy the hardware driver seperately and update the EFI with the suitable kexts and config.plist file.
