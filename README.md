# Opencore MacOS BigSur 11.4 Build for Intel i5 8600k Coffee lake Processor

## Credits : https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/prerequisites.html


Completely working OpenCore hackintosh build for a personal built PC with the Below Configurations :

> #### Processor : i5-8600k 8th gen 6-Core 3.6Ghz (Coffee Lake)
> #### Ram : 8GB 2400Mhz DDR4
> #### Storage : Sandisk 240 GB SATA SSD (+) 2x 500GB Seagate SATA HDD
> #### Motherboard : MSI Z370 Gaming M5
> #### Graphics : Intel Integrated UHD Graphics 630 


The Build lacks both WIFI and Bluetooth, As the motherboard doesn't integrate any wifi and bluetooth hardware.
I am planning to buy the hardware driver seperately and update the EFI with the suitable kexts and config.plist file.

---Update--- (12th Mar 2021)

Bluetooth Dongle from TP-Link is working fine with the build.
TP Link Archer Mini Wifi dongle is working fine, But it does require seperate driver to work. It does'nt show as inbuilt wifi device. The default Wifi menu doean't work. (The TP-Link Drivers will be automatically installed after you connect the dongle)

There is still no Airdrop working.I Think it needs inbuilt wifi chip.

---Update--- (30th May 2021)

I Have updated all the Internal drivers,kexts and Config.plist to make compatible with the lastest Mac Os BigSur 11.4.
